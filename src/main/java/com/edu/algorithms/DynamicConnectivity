Reflexive: p is connected to p
Symmetric: p is connected to q, then q is connected to p
Transitive:

Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected.

Union Find:
==========
0 to N-1

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
(2, 5)
0 1 2 3 4 2 6 7 8 9


Quick Find:
==========
Connected if int[p] == int[q]

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2, 3
0 1 2 2 4 5 6 7 8 9

2N + 2 ---> Array access

Takes N sq access to process sequence of N union commands on N objects
Quadratic (N sq)
